# Lithium Ion Cell Testing

Collecting data using a powerlab8 V2 charger. Capable of 60A discharge to a battery supply, 10A internal dissipation.

Cells tested -> Molicell INR-21700-P42A.

## Aims
- check cell capacity variance
- check cell internal resistance variance
- understand optimal cell cutoff voltage for our current draw
- measure cell response to a 60a 10 second current draw

## Repo contents
- [] raw cell data
- [] script to process raw data into useful things
- [] summary excel sheet once all data has been collected
- [] discharge plots
